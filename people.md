     <div><p class="content">Maria C. Gaztambide, Ph.D., is the inaugural director and chief curator of Public Art of the University of Houston System. Her work over the years has focused on the intersection of art, technology, and the public realm. Prior to joining the University of Houston, Dr. Gaztambide served as associate director of the International Center for the Arts of the Americas at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston  a research center focused on twentieth century Latin American and U.S. based Latino art. During her nearly 13-year tenure at MFAH, her work spanned administration, research, publications, and long-term exhibition projects such as Contesting Modernity: Informalism in Venezuela, 1955–1975 (2018), Contingent Beauty: Contemporary Art from Latin America (2015); and Intersecting Modernities: Latin American Art from the Brillembourg Capriles Collection (2013). There she also directed a continentally-scaled collaborative program centered on the archival retrieval and massive dissemination of primary sources and critical documents from Latin America and Latino U.S. that are made available to the global learning community through a web-based platform. Previously, she was a curator and taught at Tulane University; worked for the Smithsonian Institution (Archives of American Art) in Washington, New York, and Puerto Rico; as well as for the Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico during its gestational phase.</p></div>
