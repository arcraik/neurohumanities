     <div><p class="content">Akshay Ravindran is a 5th year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Houston and is the TA/Guest Lecturer for the course. His expertise lies in the population level exploration of neural features measured from the scalp using electroencephalography (EEG). His research interest includes developing brain computer interfaces, studying the brain in real-world settings, meditation, and developing modeling tools for extracting patterns from electrophysiological data. Currently, his work is centered around two main projects i) detecting the loss of balance in exoskeleton in both able-bodied and stroke survivors from the corticomuscular signals; ii) Developing interpretable deep learning models for EEG. </p></div>

She has received additional training through the month-long Gibney Dance Center Summer Study Intensive in New York City. Apart from dance, Verónica is a 2020 Mellon Scholar and conducts research in the neurohumanities. She has presented her interdisciplinary scholarship, “When Words Fail: Narrative and Dance in Posttraumatic Stress” at UH Undergraduate Research Day in September 2020, and the same work was most recently chosen to be exhibited at Texas Undergraduate Research Day in February 2021. She will also be defending her Senior Honors Thesis this coming April 2021. Verónica is currently working in collaboration with the UH School of Theatre & Dance and the Brain-Machine Interface Lab in the Cullen College of Engineering to create a dance-technology piece. She is looking forward to graduating in May 2021 and working in literary publishing or arts administration while continuing to dance. She lives in Houston, Texas.</p></div>
