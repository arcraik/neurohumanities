        <div><p class="content">Jose Luis Contreras-Vidal, Ph.D., IEEE Fellow (EMBS, SMC, RAS), is Cullen Distinguished Professor of Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering, and Director of the NSF Industry-University Collaborative Research Center on Building Reliable Advances and Innovations in Neurotechnologies (IUCRC BRAIN) at the University of Houston, and the Principal Investigator for this NSF PFI Project. He has pioneered the development of noninvasive brain-machine interfaces and wearable exoskeletons to restore motor function in individuals with spinal cord injury, stroke and limb amputation. Professor Contreras-Vidal is an associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Human Machine Systems and J of Mobile Human Computer Interaction, a Review Editor for Frontiers in Neuroprosthetics, a Topic Editor for Frontiers in Human Neuroscience and Editor-in-Chief for the incoming book (Springer Nature Switzerland AG) on Mobile Brain-Body Imaging and the Neuroscience of Art, Innovation and Creativity. His work has been supported by the NIH, NSF, VA, DARPA, ONR, Foundations, donors, and industry. Dr. Contreras-Vidal’s research has been highlighted by The Economist, Nature, Science, Science News, Der Spiegel, NSF, Wall Street Journal, SFN, O&amp;P, Scientific American, NPR’s Science Friday, and Neurology Today among others. Jose’s career development in biomedical engineering has been highlighted in the magazine Science.</p></div>

   <div class="modal-body">
       <img class="content peoplepic" src="/neurohumanities/photos/Akshay.jpg" alt="Akshay Ravindran" />
     <div><p class="content">Akshay Ravindran is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Houston who considers  Health, Education, and Spirituality to be the three pillars of his research career. His expertise lies in the population level exploration of neural features measured from the scalp using electroencephalography (EEG), and he is a strong advocate for bridging deep learning algorithms to neuroscience. Currently, his work is centered around two main projects i) detecting the loss of balance in exoskeleton in both able-bodied and stroke survivors from the corticomuscular signals; ii) studying the neurological markers of cognitive decline associated with aging.</p></div>
