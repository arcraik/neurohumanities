<b>Neurohumanities: Convergent research at the nexus of neuroengineering and the humanities</b>
<br>
Prerequisites: None
<br>
Spring 2021
<br>

The neurohumanities is an emergent field of study and research that brings together humanists (from the arts,
language, ethics, philosophy, social science, and culture) and neuroengineers into dialogue to address some of
the most pressing issues in society, e.g., including interpretable artificial intelligence and the potential for
creating intelligent robotic entities, decoding collective intelligence from social groups in the community,
understanding the brain response to the arts, and the potential for direct brain-to-brain communication. This
course will review approaches, methodologies and neurotechnologies that can be used to pursue convergent
research in the neurohumanities. This course is aimed to students from all areas of humanities and engineering.

<br>
<b>Course Topics</b>
<br>
<br>
• How to bring humanists and neuroengineers into dialogue on timely societal issues that concern
both groups.
<br>
• Discussion of discourses, methodologies, and technologies used in the humanities and
neuroengineering.
<br>
• In-depth discussion of cases studies in the arts, neuroethics, and design.
<br>
• Science dissemination with societal impact
<br>
<br>
<b>Expected Course Outcomes:</b>
<br>
<br>
• Participants will add to their knowledge-base best practices for emerging partnership for
exploring and understanding the human experience.
<br>
• Participants will further develop their basic technical skills in mobile brain-body imaging
technologies to assay the brain and the body in free behaving individuals.
<br>
• Participants will continue to develop their ability to choose between various trans-disciplinary
approaches and to learn to take systematic approaches to difficult problems, and therefore 
identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems of societal importance efficiently.
<br>
• Participants will demonstrate an appropriate level of attention to detail and the use of clear,
appropriate notation, which will facilitate their ability to communicate effectively withboth
technical colleagues and the general public.
