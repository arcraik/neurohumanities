The neurohumanities is an emergent field of study and research that brings together humanists (from the arts,
language, ethics, philosophy, social science, and culture) and neuroengineers into dialogue to address some of
the most pressing issues in society, e.g., including interpretable artificial intelligence and the potential for
creating intelligent robotic entities, decoding collective intelligence from social groups in the community,
understanding the brain response to the arts, and the potential for direct brain-to-brain communication. This
course will review approaches, methodologies and neurotechnologies that can be used to pursue convergent
research in the neurohumanities. This course is aimed to students from all areas of humanities and engineering.
