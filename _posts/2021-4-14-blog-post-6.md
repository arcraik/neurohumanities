<p>My preliminary analysis of colorfield EEG data
<br>

<p>Right after the session on colorfield was done I suggested to the team that the piece Here by Braman was my favorite. To me the piece was representative of human perception in how one sees the world. It can be quite different depending on how they look at it.

Later, I wanted to see if any EEG correlates depicted my preference. Alpha asymmetry is a measure of creative engagement which is reported to increase (more positive) when a person engages in creative tasks. I decided to test how the alpha asymmetry varied for each of the pieces.
As I mentioned, I had identified the exhibit ‘Here’ to be my favorite before the data analysis started. When looking at the feature, I also found that this piece exhibited the largest alpha asymmetry.
 Piece 5 (Pop) even though not my favorite, had a higher alpha asymmetry too. It was an exhibit of a tree and my fav thing to do on weekends is spending time in parks or near lakes which could have unconsciously elicited this response. 
 If you look during baseline (eye open resting condition, not doing any activity), you can see the value is centered at zero (similarly many other exhibits too) which indicates this measure is not always high by default. This was exciting to see a previously studied feature relating to my behavioral response.

In addition, one interesting feature I observed during the process was that my eye blink rate (BR) was heavier than usual. The mean resting BR of population is approx 20 blinks/min with a standard deviation of 10. 
My BR was normal during the baseline condition as expected. However, during the experiment, as can be seen from the following figure, I had elevated blink rates. Typically blinks are considered noise and their contributions are removed before studying brain signals.
However, the blinks play a significant yet complex role in cognition. Elevated BR could be indicative of higher mental load/tension or reduced attention.
They are also known to be reflective of dopamine activity (reward-related/ reinforcement-based actions).

At the start of the experiment, everything including the setup, media, paradigm could have triggered both elevated mental tension along with reward sensitivity causing higher BR. 
The U-shaped pattern could be indicative that I became more accustomed with time indicative of lowered BR and after a point, drowsiness/fatigue could have kicked in and the BR started to increase again. 
There is an argument to be made for fatigue causing increased BR as in general our attention gets reduced after 20-30 minutes.
 Considering the role of blinks to the dopamine system, the novelty of type of exhibits could be another key factor to consider. 
 Follow up studies looking into isolating these factors can help get a better understanding of the overall response.
