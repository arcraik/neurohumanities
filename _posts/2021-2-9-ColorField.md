<p>The first group of participants met today to discuss the background of EEG collection and analysis. Next week, this group will be investigating potential neurohumanities applications during a case study with the Color Field. The Color Field features large-scale sculptures by six contemporary artists, such as the sculptures presented below from TYPOE, and provides opportunities to question our perceptions while thinking about the impact color has on our lives.
