Nahual Project at the Moody Center for the Arts at Rice


Dr. Anthony Brandt, Professor, Composition and Theory at the Sheperd School of Music, Rice University, presents for his class "Creativity Up Close" the Nahual Project at the Moody Center for the Arts at Rice. He invited his colleague in Neuroasthetics, Dr. Jose Contreras-Vidal, Fellow IEEE and Director of the NSF Brain Center at the University of Houston, and his Nahual Team, to do a live performance/demonstration of the Nahual project. A collaboration with Artist-in-Residence at the Cullen College of Engineering Geraldina Interiano Wise, Rice'83, '85 in Architecture and Art. The Nahual, which in Maya cosmology refers to a mirror spirit assigned to each person at birth, is a live painting performance in a closed loop of the brain, during which Geraldina wears a Brain-Computer Interface that captures her brain waves during the creative process in real-time, which trigger the GAN model trained in her art.

Her brain waves trigger a grammar of sound created in collaboration with composer Amos Cochran,  towards the sonification of the brain. 


Thank you to Eric Todd and Akshay Ravindran for their invaluable work on the implementation of the project, and to Rob Blumrick for the production at the Moody Center.
