<p>Although I’ve practiced collecting data from the Muse headset, the concept of gathering my own brain
signals with ease continues to astound me. Through a collaboration with the Public Art team at the
University of Houston and the Brain-Machine Interface Systems Laboratory, I participated in a guided tour
of the Color Field exhibit, gathering brain signals as I observed and immersed myself into the university’s
first curated outdoor sculpture exhibit.
Before the tour, we were given a briefing by Dr. Maria Gaztambide, director for Public Art at the University
of Houston System, regarding the works around campus. Despite being a student, I did not recognize the
many long-standing, permanent pieces that greeted me as I walked to class. Often, we forget to realize
the beauty around campus, hidden in plain sight. Some of my campus favorites: Double Physichromie ,
Roundabout , and Tower of Cheyenne . The Color Field tour, led by Michael Guidry, presented outdoor
sculptures that used concepts of color and time in their features, provoking past memories. Through the
brain-sensing headset, I wondered how observing color stimulates the brain. Possibly, colors that bring
familiar memories would yield unique data.

Of all the works, I was astounded with TYPOE’s Forms of Life being placed in the grass field near the
fountains. Often, I would use the field as a walking shortcut to the chemistry lab from the parking lot, yet
with sculptures that resembled building blocks scattered in the area, I was not sure if students were able
to have the same luxury. “Can we walk around it?” I asked Michael. “Why not through it?” He replies with
a grin. Breaking my mental conventions of perceiving artwork, I step into the field and immerse myself.
The colors of the sculptures evoked memories of exploring indoor playgrounds as a kid. I wonder how the
Muse headset would interpret this.
The differences in brain activity during observation and reflection of creative art have yet to be explored.
Currently, there is no concrete method to gather brain signals in natural settings. Mobile scalp
encephalography provides a new playing field in contextual neuroscience, allowing data to be gathered as
participants walk with freedom of motion. This experience reveals the challenges of gathering and
segmenting useable data when viewing public artworks. Some ideas included using eye-blinks or
head-nods to segment data and logging the time of each event. This solution continues to evolve within
our program as we discover efficient ways to collect and simultaneously label the data.
