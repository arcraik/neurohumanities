<p>The first group of participants met today. The session started by introducing each other and introducing the module. Layer TA, Akshay Ravindran gave a guest lecture on basics of EEG, collection, preprocessing of muse EEG data. Next week, this group will be investigating potential neurohumanities applications during a case study with the Color Field. The Color Field features large-scale sculptures by six contemporary artists, such as the sculptures presented below from TYPOE, and provides opportunities to question our perceptions while thinking about the impact color has on our lives.
